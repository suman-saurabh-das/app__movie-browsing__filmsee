## Technologies
I have used `axios` for data fetching, `react.js` as a framework, `react-router-dom` for routing, `redux-toolkit` & `react-redux` for state management and `tailwind css` for styling.

## Setup
- Download or clone the repository
	- run `npm run start`
  
- Additional Libraries
  - axios | https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
  - react-router-dom | https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom
